    <release version="0.8.1" date="2021-05-01">
      <description>
        <p>
          Version 0.8.1 features several minor bug fixes, and various new
          translations.
        </p>
      </description>
    </release>

    <release version="0.8.0" date="2021-04-24">
      <description>
        <p>
          With Drawing 0.8.0, you can finally use a tablet and a stylus to draw
          with pressure-sensitive tools, such as the new 'brush' and 'airbrush'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fullscreen mode has been completely redesigned to provide an
          easier yet less intrusive access to the tools and their options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filters have been rewritten to be more reliable, and a new filter to
          harmoniously increase contrast has been added.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you move or delete the selection, now the pixels left behind can
          optionally be a specific color, rather than always transparency.
          This specific color can be excluded from the selection. That feature
          is complex to explain with words, try it yourself you'll see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Options such as the text background type and the shape filling style
          are now persisted when closing the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user interface for selecting the active color application mode has
          been rewritten to better show the accurate label, and better organize
          the possible modes as submenus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "blur" mode has been removed, which simplified the situation and
          allowed several tools ("shapes" and "brushes") to get support for the
          color application modes in general.
