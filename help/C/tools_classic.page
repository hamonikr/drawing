  <title>Classic tools</title>

  <p>Draw on the image with the color and options you selected!</p>

  <p>When you use a classic drawing tool, the options are located at the left of
  the bottom bar: there are two colors, the tool size, and a menu (whose content
  changes depending on the tool).</p>
  <p>To better understand the options when you change the colors, see
  <link xref="tools_classic_colors">the explanations on this page</link>.</p>

  <section id="basic-draw">
    <title>Basic lines</title>
    <list>
      <item>
        <p>Pencil: The pencil draws following the mouse pointer, and according
        to the chosen color.</p>
        <note style="tip">
          <p>Using the "eraser" mode from the color menu, the pencil can delete
          all existing colors. Using the "highlight" mode and a semi-transparent
          color, it can also highlight text. For this reason, the two next tools
          are <link xref="preferences#tools">optional</link>.</p>
        </note>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Eraser: Ignore the current color settings and just erase to get fully
        transparent pixels. Optionally, the erased pixels can be changed to the
        initial color of the canvas, or to the secondary color.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Highlighter: Ignore the transparency of the current color, and draw
        with a semi-transparent version of the current color.</p>
        <p>The "highlight" color application mode is used, so the selected color
        is added to the lighter pixels only, which highlights dark text on light
        background. An option can be used to do the opposite (highlight light
        text on dark background).</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Line: This tool can draw straight lines. Its options also include
        ending the line with an arrow, and using a gradient from the main color
        to the secondary color.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Curve: This tool can draw BÃ©zier curves, optionally with an arrow at
        the end. Two clicks are required, if you only click once to draw a
        straight line, that line is drawn temporarily until a second click.</p>
        <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
               src="figures/screenshot_arrow.png" />
      </item>
    </list>

    <p>Aside of the colors, a common option for classic tools is whether or not
    you want to use anti-aliasing. If you use anti-aliasing, the lines will look
    smoother, but it may negatively affect any following use of the <gui
    style="menuitem">Paint</gui> tool, as well as several options of the <link
    xref="tools_selection">selection</link>.</p>
    <p>With several tools, you can change the ends of the line: it can be
    rounded or square. You can also draw various patterns of dashed lines with a
    few tools.</p>

  <section id="brushes">
    <title>Pressure-sensitive brushes</title>
    <note style="warning">
      <p>This tool is disabled by default, because it has performance issues.</p>
    </note>

    <p>If you use a drawing tablet and a stylus, you may appreciate the "brush"
    tool, which reacts to the pressure of your input. Various possible brushes
    are available:</p>
    <list>
      <item>
        <p>Simple: this brush is basically a pencil with no options. The line
        will be wider if you apply more pressure. Otherwise (if you use a mouse
        for example), the width of the line will vary according to the speed of
        your movement.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Airbrush: small "droplets" of color will be added to the canvas. If
        you apply more pressure, there will be more droplets. Without a
        pressure-sensitive device, their density is constant.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Hairy brush: thin parallel lines will be added to the canvas. If you
        apply more pressure, the lines will be more outspread. Without a
        pressure-sensitive device, their proximity is constant.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Calligraphic nib: this brush draws wider in one direction than in the
        other, according to an angle which is an option of the brush. For a
        given direction, the line will be wider if you apply more pressure.
        Without a pressure-sensitive device, the width is constant for a given
        direction.</p>
      </item>
    </list>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Insert text</title>

    <p>With the <gui style="menuitem">Text</gui> tool, you can insert text on
    the image. A few formatting options are available in the options menu, such
    as "italic", "bold", or a basic font family selection.</p>

    <p>For better contrast, the text can be displayed on a rectangle background,
    or with a shadow, or with an outline. The color of this background is the
    secondary color you chose.</p>

    <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
           src="figures/screenshot_text.png" />

    <note style="tip">
      <p>Don't forget to confirm the insertion using the <gui style="button">
      Insert here</gui> button.</p>
    </note>

    <p>An optional tool named <gui style="menuitem">Points</gui> is designed to
    help you captioning pictures: you can add numbered round dots or crosses to
    elements of the picture.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Fill an area</title>

    <p>To paint an area using a given color, several tools can be used:</p>

    <list>
      <item>
        <p>Shapes. Available shapes include rectangle, rounded rectangle, oval,
        circle, polygon, and free shape.</p>
        <p>Polygons and free shapes are drawn in several clicks. To close them,
        do a last click at the position where you began the shape, or use
        the <gui style="menuitem">Close shape</gui> menu item.</p>
        <p>Various filling options are available (using a plain color, or a
        gradient, or nothing), as well as outline options (using a plain
        outline, dashes, or nothing).</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Paint. This tool tries to paint an area of a given color with a new
        color.</p>
        <note style="warning">
          <p>This tool is disabled by default, because it will not work if the
          shape to paint is too complex.</p>
        </note>
        <p>It can use several possible algorithms: <gui style="menuitem">
        Encircle and fill</gui> is very simplistic and discouraged,
        <gui style="menuitem">Erase and replace</gui> should work better, but
        still fails in a few situations.</p>
        <p>The <gui style="menuitem">Entire image</gui> option paints over the
        the entire image, regardless of what's already drawn.</p>
        <p><gui style="menuitem">Erase color</gui> doesn't paint but erase the
        color you clicked, on the entire image, for example to cut out an image
        from its white background.</p>
      </item>
    </list>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Other kinds of tools</title>

    <p>The <link xref="tools_selection">selection tools</link> don't draw, but
    their capabilities are very powerful and useful for any image editing.</p>

    <p>Use these special tools to <link xref="tools_transform">transform the
    canvas or the selected area</link>.</p>
