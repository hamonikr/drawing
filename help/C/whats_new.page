  <title>What's new?</title>

  <p>The most recent versions are listed first.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.0</title>

    <p>
      The <link xref="fullscreen">fullscreen mode</link> has been completely
      redesigned to provide an easier yet less intrusive access to the tools and
      their options.
    </p>
    <p>
      The help manual has been splitted in smaller pages to be easier to read,
      and several buttons to access it have been added across the application.
    </p>

    <subsection>
      <title>New tools</title>
      <p>
        You can now use a tablet and a stylus to <link xref="tools_classic#brushes">
        draw with pressure-sensitive brushes</link>, available under the new
        optional 'brush' tool: a simple brush, an airbrush, a hairy brush, and a
        calligraphic nib.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>New options for existing tools</title>
      <list>
        <item><p>
          The <link xref="tools_selection">selection tools</link> have a new,
          more rich, more readable bottom pane.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          <link xref="tools_transform#filters">Filters</link> have been
          rewritten to be more reliable, and a new filter to harmoniously
          increase contrast has been added.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          When you move or delete the selection, now the pixels left behind can
          optionally be a specific color, rather than always transparency.
          This specific color can be excluded from the selection. That feature
          is complex to explain with words, try it yourself you'll see.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          The eraser tool now as options: it can use a specific color, rather
          than always transparency. This option has the same value as the
          selection replacement color mentioned above. This tool also have a new
          icon, based on the Adwaita theme.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          Options such as the text background type, the shape filling style, or
          the aforementioned eraser/selection replacement color, are now
          persisted when closing the application.
        </p></item>
      </list>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Color modes</title>
      <p>
        The user interface for selecting the <link xref="tools_classic_colors">
        active color application mode</link> has been redesigned to better show
        the accurate label, and better organize the possible modes as submenus.
      </p>
      <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
             src="figures/screenshot_color_palette.png" />
      <p>
        The "blur" mode has been removed, which simplifies the situation and
        allows <link xref="tools_classic">several tools</link> ("shapes" and
        "brushes") to get support for the color application modes in general.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Bugs fixed</title>
      <p>
        Coordinates of the selection were lost when unselecting a selection
        defined by an undo.
      </p>
    </subsection>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.6.5</title>

    <p>
      Bugs fixed: the bottom panes sometimes refused to adapt to the screen
      size, and could disappear under certain conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The catastrophic "print" action, that no one ever used so no one ever
      noticed, is now somewhat usable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Importing or opening an image using drag-and-drop is now disabled with
      flatpak, because it can't work with the sandbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <link xref="zoom_preview">movements of the view</link> when holding
      and moving the middle-click are now far more accurate.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.6.4</title>

    <p>
      The value of the "use anti-aliasing" option is now persisted when the app
      is closed, and restored when the app starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various changes to the way file types are handled should help you to get
      informative error messages, and the app should be usable despite these
      errors.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.6.3</title>

    <p>
      More options to draw using dashes (several type of dashes) and arrows
      (several scenarios where they were broken have been addressed). An option
      to draw double-ended arrows is available.
    </p>
    <p>
      This version is finally compatible with older distributions (versions
      of GNOME libraries older than 3.30).
    </p>
    <p>
      When the app uses a menu-bar, the tools have been arranged in a submenu:
      "Tools / Active tool".
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.6.2</title>

    <p>
      The 'highlighter' tool now provides options to highlight light text on a
      dark background.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an image has been saved without its transparency, the app now
      suggests to reload the image from the disk. Also, this 'reload from disk'
      feature is now available with every possible window layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      An action to copy the whole image to clipboard has been added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keyboard shortcuts for increasing and decreasing the tool width have been
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'paint' tool can now optionally paint over the entire image.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.6.1</title>

    <p>
      It's now possible to remove transparency when saving PNG files too. And
      there are more color options to replace the transparent pixels: 'initial
      color' means the transparent pixels will be replaced by the initial color
      of the canvas, as set in the app preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new optional tool named "Points" has been added, it may help captioning
      pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minors bugs to the 'rotate' tool have been fixed, that occurred when the
      selection was flipped before being rotated.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.6.0</title>

    <subsection>
      <title>Zoom</title>
      <p>
        The most prominent new feature is the ability to <link xref="zoom_preview">
        zoom in (or zoom out)</link> on the image. It can be achieved using:
      </p>
      <list>
        <item><p>
          buttons in the minimap popover;
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          touch gestures (touchpad or touchscreen);
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          the mouse wheel;
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          keyboard shortcuts.
        </p></item>
      </list>
      <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
             src="figures/screenshot_zoom.png" />
      <p>
        With HiDPI displays, most problems have been fixed: the canvas should be
        displayed without unwanted rescalings and destructive croppings.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Improvements to tools</title>
      <p>
        An "additional tools" section has been added to <link xref="preferences#tools">
        the preferences window</link>, and several tools listed in this section
        are disabled by default.
        It includes tools that are redundant with other more powerful tools, or
        tools whose implementation isn't reliable enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, the following changes occurred:
      </p>
      <list>
        <item><p>
          <link xref="tools_selection">Rectangle selection and freehand
          selection</link> are now distinct tools, that share the same bottom
          pane.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          The 'rotate' tool now supports any angle when rotating the selection,
          and it handles horizontal or vertical flipping.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          The numerous tools producing shapes (circle, rectangle, polygon, â€¦),
          have been merged into a single, more consistent 'shape' tool, along
          with 'rounded rectangle' and 'ellipse'. Their filling options now
          include various types of gradients.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          The text tool can now write using most system fonts, thus allowing
          more complex characters to be used (e.g. Asian characters).
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          The 'saturate' tool has been replaced by <link xref="tools_transform#filters">
          'filters'</link>, a more powerful tool with several types of blur,
          color inversion, pixelization, saturation and transparency.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          Specialized types of pencils (eraser, highlighter) have been added, as
          optional tools.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          The "free selection" tool, as well as the "free shape" and "polygon"
          shape, are easier to use thanks to an action to close the path,
          available in the tool options menu.
        </p></item>
      </list>
      <p>
        Concerning common options, you can now disable anti-aliasing. Also, the
        "color application mode" is now an option listed in the
        <link xref="tools_classic_colors">colors menus and popovers</link>.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Other features</title>
      <p>
        A <link xref="fullscreen">fullscreen mode</link> is now available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "windows" menu has been removed from the menubar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user should be warned when they try to save despite the current
        operation not being applied.
      </p>
